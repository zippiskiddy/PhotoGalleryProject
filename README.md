A simple project as part of my studies at DCI to learn how to use `display: grid;` properly. Working time was set to 8 hours.

In the middle of the project I had to start over new, because I wasn't able to implement my first idea, so I started using `display: grid;` within `display: grid;` and this is my final result. 

A "grid"-ception.

## Road to

1. Building the basic HTML structure
2. Implementing the CSS Stylesheet
3. Including images
4. Fine grinding
5. Adding media query
