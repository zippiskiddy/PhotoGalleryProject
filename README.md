# PhotoGalleryProject

A little photo gallery using `display: grid;` for the first time.

## About

A simple project to learn how to use `display: grid;` properly.
In the middle of the project I had to start over new, because I wasn't able to implement my first idea, so I started using `display: grid;` within `display: grid;` and this is my final result. 

A "grid"-ception.
